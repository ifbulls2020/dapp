	"key15": "Due to the high volatility of digital currency, there will be a certain difference in the currency value of each exchange. Arbitrage is buying an asset in a market with a lower price and selling it at a higher price in another exchange market. Buy low and sell high. The spread in the middle is the profit, we call this operation arbitrage",
	"key16": "Suppose the EOS/USDT trading pair: the currency price is 11, the currency price is 10, and the EOS price difference between the two exchanges is $1. Suppose you hold 1 EOS in Coinbase, follow the principle of buying high and buying low. Selling 1 EOS on Coinbase will get 11 USDT, buying 1 EOS on Binance will cost 10 USDT. Buy one sell one pure profit. 1 USDT, the number of EOS remains unchanged. Although there are such price differences, manual arbitrage often has many uncertainties due to time-consuming manual operations, poor accuracy, and price changes. Use quantitative models to capture arbitrage opportunities and develop arbitrage trading strategies. Programmed algorithms automatically issue trading orders to exchanges, quickly and accurately capture opportunities, and earn profits efficiently.",
